	The Datical DB Action is the action you wish Datical DB to perform.
	<br>
	<br>
	This can include the following:

	<li><tt>Forecast</tt> - provides a report detail the changes, if any, that will be applied to your database along with impact analysis. This does NOT commit changes to your database. This file will be stored in your build workspace. Requires DB Server specification.
	<li><tt>Snapshot</tt> - reverse engineers your database schema to a Datical DB XML file. This file will be stored in your build workspace. Requires DB Server specification.
	<li><tt>Deploy</tt> - executes any changes required as detailed in your Project. This will generate a report detailing the chnages and be stored in your build workspace. Requires DB Server specification.  
	<li><tt>Status</tt> - provides the current status of the database in relation to your Project. DB Server specification is optional.
	<li><tt>Status (Detailed)</tt> - details the current status of the database in relation to your Project. DB Server specification is required.
	<li><tt>Check Drivers</tt> - validates the appropriate JDBC driver is available to Datical DB for your specific Project. The location of the drivers is specified in the Jenkins global config. (Jenkins --> Manage Jenkins --> Configure System --> Datical DB)
	<li><tt>Check Rules</tt> - validates the Rules located in your Datical DB project.
	<li><tt>Generate Change Log from Differences</tt> - generates a new Change Log representing the difference between two databases in your Datical DB project. Two Servers are required (e.g., <i>Source Target</i>). diffChangelog <i>reference db</i> <i>target db</i> --output <i>path</i>. Output is optional.
	<li><tt>Generate Report from Differences</tt> - like the previous Action, generates a report representing the difference between two databases in your Datical DB project. Two Servers are required (e.g., <i>Source</i> <i>Target</i>). diff <i>reference db</i> <i>target db</i>.
	<li><tt>History</tt> - provides a history report of changes applied to your database(s).
	<li><tt>Rollback</tt> - Roll the target database back to a given revision, date or by number of steps.
	<li><tt>Deploy with Auto Rollback</tt> - Identical to "Deploy" but will Automatically Rollback to previous state in event of error.
	<li><tt>Create Datical Project</tt> - Creates a new Datical Project in the Project Directory. Useful for when you are only provided the changelog.xml file.
	<li><tt>Create New Database Definition</tt> - Adds a new Database Definition to an existing Datical Project. (e.g., <i>DbDefClass MysqlDbDef name Dev username datical password password hostname localhost port 3306 database dev</i>)
	<li><tt>Install License</tt> - Installs a license file. Requires the path to the new license file.
